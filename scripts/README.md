# Scripts include:
* log in set up info for plat type at what hydroponic pots, 
*  monitor system that uses Near IR cam to track plant's health and yield data readings
*  monitor soil moisture at each plant pts and yeild data readings
*  log daily or hourly reports of each plant (statiscally determine the correlation between amount fo water & sunlight to plant's health)
*  calulate the amount of water and sunlight needed for the plant (each pod has own servo closing water door, sunlight is emitting indoor UV lights) based on statistics collected and opensource information dictionary
* a dictionary .json/txt... that stores opensource information 
* driver codes that uses arduino nano & raspberry pi/arduino nano to control water flow an sunlight levels
* monitor water temperature & purity, contents, nutrient concetration (need research)
* GUI showing the general readings and status of system health , plants status, water quality and sunlgiht levels


** User Interface

* Setup process
* Logging access and editing fields, adding/ remove fields
* Input opensource information into dictionary repository
